# Android Security

### Why should you improve Android security?

Every operating system is vulnerable to malware and exploits. In the past, we've witnessed zero-click vulnerabilities that can be exploited without any user interaction. 

This highlights the need for security software that can monitor network connections, file changes, and program executions to keep your device secure.
