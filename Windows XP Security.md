# :window: Windows XP Security

### Why should you improve Windows XP security?

Using unsupported operating systems can increase the risk of infection and data theft.

This guide is for those who want to use or test an operating system after it is no longer officially supported. It provides information about system administration tools and security software that are still updated or compatible with XP.

### Windows Update

> [!NOTE]
> Restore Windows Update and provide a set of +150 updates for XP, which has been developed until the year 2019.

**Legacy Update (Free)** (https://legacyupdate.net/)

:100: Fully restores Windows Updates and its functionality.

:fire: Enables POSReady updates (developed until the year 2019!).

*Note: Works very well, but some updates may be difficult to install, keep trying to install common updates after the major ones.*


### Antimalware solution

> [!NOTE]
> Provides decent malware protection and exploit detection.

**Panda Dome (Free)** (https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/free-antivirus/)

:100: Have real-time and cloud-based scanning, URL monitoring, USB vaccination.

:fire: Still receiving major build and vaccine updates.

*Note: Do not have a level of security to set more performance or security, may not have the greatest detection rate (especially PUP/PUA), at least in my expirience. It will catch backdoors and very aggressive malware.*

**Malwarebytes Antimalware (Paid or Limited Free)** (https://archive.org/details/malwarebytes-3.5.1.2522)

:100: Have exploit mitigation and advanced malware detection systems.

:rotating_light: No longer have build updates, but still receive vaccine updates.

*Note: After the Premium trial period, you will no longer have real-time scanning.*

### Exploit Migitation

> [!NOTE]
> Tools to make vulnerability exploitation more difficult.

**Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit V4.1 (Free)** (https://web.archive.org/web/20140514132216/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=41138)

### Web browsers

> [!NOTE]
> Web browsers that really fully works.

**Supermium (Free)** (https://win32subsystem.live/supermium/)

:100: Fast updates, a week or two after official Google Chrome updates.

:fire: The latest features and extensions from Google Chrome work just fine.

*Note: Impressive how well it runs on old hardware (I tested it on my old 2007 Intel processor).*
